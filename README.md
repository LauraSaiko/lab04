### Questions:
##### 1. What is HTML and what are HTML tags?

HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language, a system which allows all kinds of content display on World Wide Web pages. 
HTML tags are words enclosed by `<` and `>`, and with the tags, we can display all kinds of content on our web pages, 
text, colour, shapes, images, hyperlinks etc. 

##### 2. How many levels of heading does an HTML have?

Six levels. 
`<h1></h1>`, `<h2></h2>`, `<h3></h3>`, `<h4></h4>`, `<h5></h5>` and `<h6></h6>`. 

##### 3. Here is a HTML page that has a syntax error:
```html
<h3>This is my awesome title!</h1>
```
##### What does it look like in a rendered page?

I tried it out on my task 1 page.
